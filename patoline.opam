synopsis: "Patoline typesetting system and libraries"
description:
"""
Patoline is a collection of typesetting libraries designed to be combined into
a variety of possible applications. Its primary goal is not to offer the
definitive answer to all typesetting problems, but rather to write the painful
and boring parts of the job, so that interesting tools could be written
easily. Obviously, a related (but much smaller) project is the Patoline
compiler, which compiles a mixed Wiki/LaTeX/Ocaml syntax into a variety of
output formats, including traditional PDF files, but also web servers that
deliver dynamic contents.
