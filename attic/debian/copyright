 Copyright FAQ
 =============
 .
    1. I don't understand the resale restriction... What gives?
 .
       Bitstream is giving away these fonts, but wishes to ensure its
       competitors can't just drop the fonts as is into a font sale system
       and sell them as is. It seems fair that if Bitstream can't make money
       from the Bitstream Vera fonts, their competitors should not be able to
       do so either. You can sell the fonts as part of any software package,
       however.
 .
    2. I want to package these fonts separately for distribution and
       sale as part of a larger software package or system.  Can I do so?
 .
       Yes. A RPM or Debian package is a "larger software package" to begin 
       with, and you aren't selling them independently by themselves. 
       See 1. above.
 .
    3. Are derivative works allowed?
       Yes!
 .
    4. Can I change or add to the font(s)?
       Yes, but you must change the name(s) of the font(s).
 .
    5. Under what terms are derivative works allowed?
 .
       You must change the name(s) of the fonts. This is to ensure the
       quality of the fonts, both to protect Bitstream and Gnome. We want to
       ensure that if an application has opened a font specifically of these
       names, it gets what it expects (though of course, using fontconfig,
       substitutions could still could have occurred during font
       opening). You must include the Bitstream copyright. Additional
       copyrights can be added, as per copyright law. Happy Font Hacking!
 .
    6. If I have improvements for Bitstream Vera, is it possible they might get 
        adopted in future versions?
 .
       Yes. The contract between the Gnome Foundation and Bitstream has
       provisions for working with Bitstream to ensure quality additions to
       the Bitstream Vera font family. Please contact us if you have such
       additions. Note, that in general, we will want such additions for the
       entire family, not just a single font, and that you'll have to keep
       both Gnome and Jim Lyles, Vera's designer, happy! To make sense to add
       glyphs to the font, they must be stylistically in keeping with Vera's
       design. Vera cannot become a "ransom note" font. Jim Lyles will be
       providing a document describing the design elements used in Vera, as a
       guide and aid for people interested in contributing to Vera.
 .
    7. I want to sell a software package that uses these fonts: Can I do so?
 .
       Sure. Bundle the fonts with your software and sell your software
       with the fonts. That is the intent of the copyright.
 .
    8. If applications have built the names "Bitstream Vera" into them, 
       can I override this somehow to use fonts of my choosing?
 .
       This depends on exact details of the software. Most open source
       systems and software (e.g., Gnome, KDE, etc.) are now converting to
       use fontconfig (see www.fontconfig.org) to handle font configuration,
       selection and substitution; it has provisions for overriding font
       names and subsituting alternatives. An example is provided by the
       supplied local.conf file, which chooses the family Bitstream Vera for
       "sans", "serif" and "monospace".  Other software (e.g., the XFree86
       core server) has other mechanisms for font substitution.

 Copyright 1999 2002-2008 LaTeX3 Project
     Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but modification of it is not allowed.
 .
 .
 PREAMBLE
 ========
 .
 The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under
 which the LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.
 .
 You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright
 and which you wish to distribute.  This license may be particularly
 suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but 
 it is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is 
 unrelated to TeX.
 .
 The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',
 below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors
 who are considering distributing their works under this license.
 .
 This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed
 and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of
 that work may be distributed.
 .
 We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you
 the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work
 that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while
 maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of
 that work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while
 meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'
 and `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.
 .
 .
 DEFINITIONS
 ===========
 .
 In this license document the following terms are used:
 .
    `Work'
     Any work being distributed under this License.
 .
    `Derived Work'
     Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.
 .
    `Modification' 
     Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable
     law -- for example, the production of a file containing an
     original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of
     such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.
 .
    `Modify'
     To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any
     applicable law.
 .
    `Distribution'
     Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in
     whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)
     making any electronic components of the Work accessible by
     file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file
     systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).
 .
    `Compiled Work'
     A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it
     is directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may
     include using installation facilities provided by the Work,
     transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or
     other activities.  Note that modification of any installation
     facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.
 .
    `Current Maintainer'
     A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is
     no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under
     any applicable law.
 .
    `Base Interpreter' 
     A program or process that is normally needed for running or
     interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.    
 .
     A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these
     are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each
     external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used
     interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the
     license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a
     `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the 
     `LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'.
 .
 .
 .
 CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 ===========================================
 .
 1.  Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work
 are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In
 particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no
 requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.
 .
 2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you
 received it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered
 modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived
 Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.
 .
 3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a
 complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2
 above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that
 the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly
 as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work
 directly from the Work.
 .
 4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without
 restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may
 also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including
 Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works
 distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to
 be updated versions of the Work.
 .
 5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify
 your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,
 and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on
 the Derived Work.
 .
 6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
 distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met
 for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states
 in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition.  Only
 the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption 
 to a component of the Work. 
 .
   a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement
      for a component of the Work when that component is used with the
      Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work
      identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that
      Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work
      clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version
      of this component to the user when used interactively with that
      Base Interpreter.
 .
   b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices
      detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a
      prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part
      of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log
      of the changes.
 .
   c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,
      including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version
      of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)
      the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the
      Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that
      they do provide such support for the Derived Work.
 .
   d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:
 .
        1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; 
           if your distribution of a modified component is made by
           offering access to copy the modified component from a
           designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
           the Work from the same or some similar place meets this
           condition, even though third parties are not compelled to
           copy the Work along with the modified component;
 .
        2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,
           unmodified copy of the Work.
 .
 7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
 distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as
 the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled
 Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with
 regard to the Derived Work.
 .
 8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not
 apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it
 becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as
 it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.
 .
 9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative
 format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is
 then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or
 nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of
 applying that process.
 .
 10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license
        provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in
        Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have
        to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.
 .
     b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that
        Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of
        itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the 
        restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.
 .
 11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to
 the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating
 such works with the Work by any means.
 .
 12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent
 complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.
 .
 .
 NO WARRANTY
 ===========
 .
 There is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in
 writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without
 warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not
 limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
 particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance
 of the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you assume
 the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.
 .
 In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing
 will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the
 Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as
 permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general,
 special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of
 the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited
 to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by
 anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other
 programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other
 party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 .
 .
 MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK
 =======================
 .
 The Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder
 explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in
 the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder
 or simply that it is `author-maintained'.
 .
 The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer
 who has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error
 reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail
 address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge
 or act upon these error reports.
 .
 The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there
 is no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current
 Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means
 of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other
 significant signs of active maintenance.
 .
 You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with
 any existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.
 .
 If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of
 the Work through the following steps:
 .
  1.  Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and
      the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of
      an Internet or similar search.
 .
  2.  If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work
      is still maintained.
 .
   a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer
      to update their communication data within one month.
 .
   b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active
      maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce
      within the pertinent community your intention to take over
      maintenance.  (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be
      done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)
 .
  3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass
      maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect
      immediately upon announcement.
 .
   b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright
      Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you,
      then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.  
 .
  4.  If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above
      and after three months your intention is challenged neither by
      the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other
      people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as
      to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.
 .
  5.  If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes
      reachable once more within three months of a change completed
      under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must
      become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided
      they then update their communication data within one month.
 .
 A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact
 that the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.
 .
 If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should
 immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous
 statement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You should also
 announce your new status to the same pertinent community as
 in 2b) above.

 WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE
 ======================================================
 .
 This section contains important instructions, examples, and
 recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their
 works under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in
 this section.
 .
 Choosing This License or Another License
 ----------------------------------------
 .
 If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*
 conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then
 do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,
 distribute your work under a different license.  You may use the text
 of this license as a model for your own license, but your license
 should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that
 your work is distributed under the LPPL.
 .
 The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains
 the motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,
 for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public
 License (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your work is
 unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be
 relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any
 license are encouraged to read it.
 .
 A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution
 -----------------------------------------------------
 .
 It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own
 personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for
 distributing the modified component.  While you might intend that such
 modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by
 accident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or
 it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified
 version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions
 of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,
 cause problems for the community.  It is therefore usually in your
 best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public
 one.  Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work
 without altering any of its licensed components.
 .
 How to Use This License
 -----------------------
 .
 To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both
 an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work
 was authored and/or last substantially modified.  Include also a
 statement that the distribution and/or modification of that
 component is constrained by the conditions in this license.
 .
 Here is an example of such a notice and statement:
 .
   %% pig.dtx
   %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name
   %
   % This work may be distributed and/or modified under the
   % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3
   % of this license or (at your option) any later version.
   % The latest version of this license is in
   %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
   % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
   % version 2005/12/01 or later.
   %
   % This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.
   % 
   % The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.
   %
   % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins
   % and the derived file pig.sty.
 .
 Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions
 given in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring
 to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being
 generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'
 referring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and
 `Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.
 .
 If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your
 Work, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'.  
 However, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance
 section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to
 the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it
 yourself.
 .
 Derived Works That Are Not Replacements
 ---------------------------------------
 .
 Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and
 stability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves
 with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a
 (compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If
 this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a
 completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.
 .
 .
 Important Recommendations
 -------------------------
 .
  Defining What Constitutes the Work
 .
    The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the
    files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a
    way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.
    This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the
    files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by
    using a line such as:
 .
     % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.
 .
    in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be
    impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you
    to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be
    entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise
    the Work.
